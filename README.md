# VL.SocketIOClient

**DEPRECATED : see [VL.SocketIO](https://github.com/sebescudie/VL.SocketIO) instead**

_A set of nodes to interact with a [socket.io](https://socket.io) server._

This plugin is still a work in progress !

Documentation is a bit harsh for now, but I'll clean the whole thing soon as I get it working properly. Any help is welcome :)

## Usage

- Runs on vvvv 36.1 alpha (tested with rc6)
- Install nodeJS
- `cd` to the `test_server` folder and run `npm install`, this will install dependencies needed by the test server
- Open `root.v4p` and follow the instructions
